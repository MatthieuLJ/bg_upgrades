* Offer the option to not draw the fold lines
* Adjust the form's layout so that the (i) always stays next to the button and to be able to reset the file input fields
* The pattern on the lip should be full visibility at least for the size of the notch
* Look at gathering some metrics (options, image created, computation time, data upload time)
? Draw at higher precision than mm?
? Add a watermark on the generated PDF (with tool version number)
? Look if it needs a progress bar when uploading large files
