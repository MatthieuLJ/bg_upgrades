Next steps:
-> Add fields in the form to upload pictures for the sides
* Use those files to generate the PDF (and actually generate the whole thing)
* Change the 3D model to use those images
* Add buttons to rotate the pictures on the sides
* Check for the size of the model compared to the paper
* Generate box template that go over two pages (give a warning when that happens)
