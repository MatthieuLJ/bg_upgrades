Next steps:
* Look if it needs a progress bar when uploading large files
* Add markers on the edge for where to fold the pattern
* Offer the option to not draw the fold lines
* Look at gathering some metrics
* Drag and drop the pictures into the different fields
* Generate box template that go over two pages (give a warning when that happens)
* Give the option for boxes with two openings
* Adapt to be able to build bitboxes
