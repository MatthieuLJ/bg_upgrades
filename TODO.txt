Next steps:
-> Add fields in the form to upload pictures for the sides
-> Use those files to generate the PDF (and actually generate the whole thing)
-> Complete the PDF generation (all faces, 2 ended, layout of the paper, two pages)
* Scale 3D model so that it's always visible
* Add orbit controls to rotate the 3D model
* Change the 3D model to use those images
* Add buttons to rotate the face pictures by 90Â° increment
* Check for the size of the model compared to the paper
* Generate box template that go over two pages (give a warning when that happens)
