Next steps:
* Scale 3D model so that it's always visible
* Add orbit controls to rotate the 3D model
* Change the 3D model to use those images
* Add buttons to rotate the face pictures by 90Â° increment
* Check for the size of the model compared to the paper (modify the layout if needed)
* Generate box template that go over two pages (give a warning when that happens)
* Give the option for boxes with two openings
