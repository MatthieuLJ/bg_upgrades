Next steps:
* Add unit tests for the flow and celery tasks
* Add unit tests for Three.js 3D model
* Look at gathering some metrics (options, image created, computation time, data upload time)
    - https://github.com/frankwiles/django-app-metrics
* Look at proper deployment (secret key, debug mode, admin account, flower interface)
? Draw at higher precision than mm (accept floats for dimensions)
? Add a watermark on the generated PDF (with tool version number)
? Drag and drop the pictures into the different fields
* Give the option for boxes with openings on both ends
* Generate box template that go over two pages (give a warning when that happens)
