Next steps:
* The pattern on the lip should be full visibility at least for the size of the notch
* Look at gathering some metrics (options, image created, computation time, data upload time)
? Draw at higher precision than mm?
? Add a watermark on the generated PDF (with tool version number)
? Look if it needs a progress bar when uploading large files
? Drag and drop the pictures into the different fields
* Give the option for boxes with openings on both ends
* Generate box template that go over two pages (give a warning when that happens)
* Adapt to be able to build bitboxes
